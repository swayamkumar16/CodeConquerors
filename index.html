    <main>
        <section>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The DTMF controlled door lock system uses Dual Tone Multi Frequency (DTMF) signals from a mobile phone to control the locking and unlocking mechanism of a door.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Components</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Mobile Phone</li>
                <li>MT8870 DTMF Decoder</li>
                <li>7404 Hex Inverter</li>
                <li>L293D Motor Driver</li>
                <li>Door Mechanism</li>
                <li>Power Supply (+5V)</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Operation</h2>
            <p>When the first phone receives a call, it transmits DTMF signals. The MT8870 DTMF decoder processes these signals and outputs a corresponding binary code. The 7404 hex inverter processes these signals and sends them to the L293D motor driver, which controls the door mechanism to open or close the door based on the received DTMF signals.</p>

            <h2>Advantages</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Remote Control: The system allows users to control the door from a remote location using a mobile phone, providing convenience and enhanced security.</li>
                <li>Cost-Effective: The components required for a DTMF-controlled door lock system are relatively inexpensive, making it a cost-effective solution compared to other sophisticated access control systems.</li>
                <li>Ease of Implementation: The circuit design and implementation are straightforward, which makes it a good project for hobbyists and students.</li>
                <li>No Internet Required: Unlike smart locks that rely on Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, DTMF systems only need a phone call, which can be beneficial in areas with poor internet connectivity.</li>
                <li>Compatibility: The system is compatible with any phone that can generate DTMF signals, ensuring wide compatibility.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Limited Security: DTMF signals can be intercepted or duplicated, making the system less secure than more advanced access control methods.</li>
                <li>Dependency on Phone Network: The system relies on the availability and reliability of the phone network, which might not always be dependable.</li>
                <li>Latency Issues: There might be a delay in signal transmission, causing a lag in the door locking or unlocking process.</li>
                <li>Limited Functionality: The system only provides basic control (lock/unlock) and lacks advanced features like user authentication and access logs.</li>
                <li>Maintenance: The system requires regular maintenance to ensure all components are functioning correctly, which can be a hassle.</li>
            </ul>
